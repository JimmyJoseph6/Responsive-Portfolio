      <p>I  know you’ll face pain, suffering, hard choices but you can’t let the weight of it choke the joy out of your life. No matter what, you have to find the things that love you." ~ Jaxson Teller</p>

      <p>Every time I think maybe I'm heading in the right direction, I end up in a place I never even knew could feel this bad. </p>

      <p>It's hard not to hate. People, things, institutions. When they break your spirit and take pleasure in watching you bleed... hate is the only feeling that makes sense. But I know what hate does to a man. Tears him apart. Turns him into something he's not. Something he promised
          himself he'd never become.</p>
